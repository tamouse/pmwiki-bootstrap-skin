# Alternate PmWiki Bootstrap skin

[Michael Paulukonis](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis) is working on another Twitter Bootstrap PmWiki skin at [https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/pmwiki-bootstrap-skin ](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/pmwiki-bootstrap-skin) and at some point I plan to merge my stuff with his. Please give Michael's work some love, it's a much grander scheme than I have going here, which is pretty much just what I wanted to get going before Michael's is ready to release.
